[Datebook] 25-2-2002  4423 Pine  • driveway/wall arrangement we'd discussed was not acceptable to L&I.  • the driveway would be 18 feet wide, the flare at the end would be 18 inches, and the [wall would be 3.5 feet high.]  • [Mark agreed to put a speed bump in the lot just before the driveway.]  • [We also agreed that  they drive should be as steep as possible when it hits the street,  preferring to rise from street to curb level in six to nine inches  rather than 18.] Our concern is motorists from the street (or the lot)  crossing the sidewalk quickly when, for example, kids are playing in  plain view of a slowly idling driver but out of sight until too late  of a driver traveling at or above 15 mph.  • [Mark and Barry agreed to approach L&I together about the traffic calming aspects of a steep curb cut.]  • [In conversation afterwards, I asked Russ if they could help us opening  tree pits on the block for the block tree planting. He said truly they  would have the equipment on site to do so, and so it was no problem to  open some extra pits for us at that time.] {2 pits, both theirs, none palm court.}

[Datebook] 20-5-2003  10:0 - 11:0  Physics Colloq: Moon  Matheson Hall 311  Heresy from the Vatican: Lunatic Ideas about the Evolution of the Moon  Professor Guy Consolmagno, SJ  Vatican Observatory Research Group  Steward Observatory  University of Arizona    The magma ocean model for the early Moon's evolution has been one of the most important and influential hypotheses to come out of the Apollo program. But in the 1970's Cameron first suggested that the Moon formed as the result of a Mars-sized planetesimal impacting onto the Earth.  Since the 1980's this model has gained significant favor.  It uniquely can explain the Moon's nearly circular but mildly inclined orbit; and, frankly, no other viable theory for the origin of the moon exists.    However, the nature of the impact has profound implications for both the physical origin of any magma ocean, and for the Moon's bulk composition.  In fact, it may make the traditional magma ocean theory completely untenable. So what can replace that theory and still make the lunar highlands?  We will explore the evidence from lunar seismology, chemistry, and physics to suggest a new way of looking at the Moon.

Leu, W. Regli and W. Sun on swept volumes, their applications to virtual sculpting and tissue engineering, and their use as models for resolving some fundamental problems in the new area of computational topology will be described. Swept volumes are geometric objects comprised of the totality of points traversed when an object is moved (and possibly deformed) through space. Computational topology is the study of algorithmic methods for rendering geometric objects without altering any aspects of their shape.    Some novel algorithmic methods for analyzing and representing swept volumes will be presented, and it will be shown how these approaches lend themselves to important applications in virtual manufacturing and design, and in the modeling of heterogeneous materials arising in tissue engineering.    These approaches will then be re-examined in the context of computational topology, and it will be demonstrated how swept volumes can provide valuable insights into the development of programs that include effectively computable shape verification criteria (based, for example, on techniques from algebraic and differential topology). Emphasis will be placed on how the multidisciplinary confluence of mathematics, manufacturing engineering, and computer science provides a powerful means for formulating and solving theoretical and applied problems related to the computational representation of geometric objects.

In this expository talk, I will explore the role of vision as a sensor for interaction with physical space. Since the complexity of the physical world is far superior to that of its measured images, inferring a generic representation of the scene is an intrinsically ill-posed problem. However, the task becomes well-posed within the context of a specific control task. I will display recent results in the inference of dynamical models of visual scenes for the purpose of motion control, shape visualization, rendering, and classification.

[Datebook] 25-11-2003  15:0 - 16:0  John Lafferty talk  Wu & Chen Auditorium  Levine Hall    Data and Structure in Machine Learning    Computing in the 20th century was dominated by a focus on computation time and processing speed, with Moore's law used as a popular scale for charting hardware advances. The 21st century will be the "data century," and computing research will become dominated by a focus on manipulating data rather than cycles. A broad challenge to computer science is to develop tools that enable efficient and effective use of the massive amounts of data that are becoming available. This talk will focus on an interesting corollary to the data deluge: since human annotated data will remain limited and expensive to obtain, the problem of combining annotated and raw data is of fundamental importance. We will present recent work on the problem of semi-supervised machine learning, including learning from structured data. Our underlying approach is based on the use of random fields, graphical models, and graph kernels, tools that have been playing a central role in the systematic development of statistical learning algorithms, an area of research that has been proceeding at a rapid and exciting pace in recent years.

The Westphal Picture Gallery houses the tall-case clock, made in 1773 by Philadelphia clockmaker David Rittenhouse (1732-1796). It is one of the most complex clocks ever created; the nine-foot high clock's uppermost dial, the orrery, gives the positions of the then-known planets with respect to one another and to the signs of the zodiac. Its center dial, the lunarium, shows the phases of the moon.    The clock also illustrates the date, time of day, strikes quarterly and hourly with two sets of chimes and plays ten English tunes. It was presented to the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry in 1894 by the widow of George W. Childs, Anthony J. Drexel's best friend.

[Datebook] 4-12-2003  12:0 - 13:0  Dimension reduction and information theory  Naftali Tishby, The Hebrew University  Dimension reduction and information theory - what's the connection?    Lecture: Thursday, December 4, 2003  Levine Hall, Room 307    In this talk I will take a new look at Shannon's Information theory from a Machine Learning perspective. I will argue that Shannon's theory provides a compelling mechanism for quantifying the fundamental tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, by unifying the source and channel coding theorems into one principle which I call the "Information Bottleneck" (IB). This unified view of the coding theorems can shed new light on the question of "relevant data representation" and suggests new algorithms for extracting such representations from co-occurrence statistics. In the second part I will briefly examine two different applications of this principle to continuous dimension reduction and feature extraction from high dimensional datasets, Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) and Gaussian-IB, both provide nonlinear continuous dimension reduction that preserve relevant information.

The guiding philosophy in this work is to avoid traditional problems such as complete map building and localization by constructing a minimal representation based entirely on critical events in on-line sensor measurements made by the robot. We present an algorithm for building the GNG in an unknown environment. The resulting data structure provides a sensor-feedback motion strategy that guides the robot between any two environment locations, and allows the search of static targets, even though there is no geometric map of the environment. In simply-connected environments, the resulting trajectory is optimal, and in multiply-connected environments, it is optimal within a homotopy class. We have also developed GNG-based algoritms that solve visibility-based pursuit-evasion problems. The GNG algorithms have been implemented, and the model was experimentally validated on a real mobile robot. Results are presented in which the robot builds the data structure on-line, and is able to use it without needing a global reference frame. Furthermore, simulation results are shown in which the robot performs optimal navigation, optimal searching for static objects, and on-line pursuit-evasion.

Physical database design is the process of determining the optimal configuration of physical files and access structures for a given set of queries. Recently, many multidimensional file organizations have been  proposed in the literature. However, there has been no effort toward their physical database design. We first show that the performance of query processing is highly affected by the similarity between the shapes of query regions and page regions in the domain space, and then propose a method for finding the optimal configuration of the multidimensional file by controlling the interval ratio of different axes to achieve the similarity. For performance evaluation, we perform extensive experiments with the multilevel grid file, a multidimensional file organization, using various types of queries and record distributions. The results indicate that our proposed method builds optimal multilevel grid files regardless of the query types and record distributions. When the interval ratio of a two-dimensional query region is 1:1024, the performance of the proposed method is enhanced by as much as 7.5 times over that of the conventional method that has an interval ratio of 1:1 employing the cyclic splitting strategy. The performance is further enhanced for query types having higher interval ratios. The result is significant since interval ratios can be far from 1:1 for many practical applications, especially when different axes have different domains.

After briefly reviewing some of these "fruits" I will discuss the limitations of MDP models and the need to go beyond them. The standard extension of MDPs to partially-observable MDPs, or POMDPs, haven't served us well, at least so far. In this talk, I will present predictive state representations, or PSRs, a new class of predictive models for discrete-time controlled dynamical systems. The key idea in PSRs is to use predictions of observable outcomes of tests or experiments the agent can do in its environment to represent the state of the environment. I will show that PSRs are more general than POMDPs and yet are at least as, and often more, compact than POMDPs. I will also present some results on learning PSR models from data and conclude with some reasons for optimism about PSR models as well as with directions for future work on PSRs.

[Datebook] 29-1-2004  14:0 - 15:0  Colloquium  Thomas Funkhouser  Princeton University    Abstract    As the number of 3D models available on the Web grows, there is an increasing need for a search engine to help people find them (e.g., a Google for 3D models).  Unfortunately, traditional text-based search techniques are not always effective for 3D data. In this talk, we investigate new shape-based search methods. A key challenge is to find a computational representation of shape (a "shape descriptor") that is concise, robust, quick to compute, efficient to match, and discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes. In this talk, I will describe shape descriptors designed for computer graphics models commonly found on the Web (i.e., they may contain arbitrary degeneracies and alignments).  We have experimented with them in a Web-based search engine that allows users to query for 3D models based on similarities to 3D sketches, 3D models, 2D sketches, and/or text keywords.

In a nanotube, low bias transport can be nearly ballistic across distances of several hundred nanometers.  Deposition of high-k gate insulators does not degrade the carrier mobility because the topological structure results in an absence of dangling bonds.  Fermi level pining at the metal-nanotube interface is weak, so a range of Schottky barrier heights can be achieved by using different contact metals. The conduction and valence bands are symmetric, which is advantageous for complementary applications.  The bandstructure is direct, which enables optical emission, and finally, CNTs are highly resistant to electromigration. Because of these attractive features, carbon nanotubes are receiving much attention for possible device applications.  In this talk, I will summarize the results of an on-going collaboration between experiment and simulation, which is leading to an improved understanding of device physics, development of simulation approaches and software, and rapidly improving device performance. Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors provide a concrete context for exploring device physics and developing a simulation capability. We have developed an empirical (pz orbital) atomistic, quantum simulator for nanotube transistors. The simulator uses the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to treat ballistic and dissipative quantum transport in the presence of self-consistent electrostatics. The essence of this simulator will be described. The important issues related to nanotube device physics and applications will be explored.

Examples include systems we (and others) have built to solve problems in distributed robotics (e.g. localization, coverage, navigation, task allocation) using a network of sensors. I will discuss the algorithms we have devised for some of these talks, and their characterization. I will argue that in return, robotics can potentially alter the way wireless sensor networks are deployed, maintained, repaired, and replenished, illustrating once again with experimental systems we have built in the lab.

Although it might seem as if there is more than enough insecurity here to keep all of us fully occupied for the foreseeable future, our narrow view of our jobs may actually be part of the problem. We miss important insights from, and opportunities to make contributions to, a larger world that has been grappling with security since long before the computer was invented.    This informal talk will look at "human scale" security problems and protocols, with an eye toward discovering what they can teach us and how we might use the techniques of computer security to improve them. Once we look, we discover interesting problems across a wide spectrum of areas, ranging from the very serious (preventing terrorists from hijacking airplanes) to the personal (being sure you get the same wine you ordered).

In my presentation, I will present ways to incorporate such information into image segmentation methods. In particular, I will present:                                                                                    - the 'Diffusion Snake' as a fast spline-based implementation of the Mumford-Shah functional                                                                                    - 'Motion Competition' as an extension of the Mumford-Shah framework from intensity segmentation to motion segmentation. Segmenting contours are represented either by splines or by level sets.                                                                                    - the integration of higher-level statistical shape priors into the segmentation processes. This permits to cope with noise, background clutter and partial occlusions of the objects of interest.

[Datebook] 20-2-2004  11:0 - 12:0  grasp  Location --  Levine Hall, Room 307    Dr. Greg Grudic  University of Colorado, Boulder  Department of Computer Science    Hosted by:  Vijay Kumar    Title: "Using Probabilistic Regression and Classification Models for End-to-End Learning of Robotic Tasks"    Abstract  <><><><>  A perpetual question in mobile robot control is how to describe tasks and programs in terms of behaviors or modes. We address this problem by having a human teleoperator demonstrate a task, and applying a Supervised Learning approach that identifies modes. This is achieved by determining regions of the state space where actuator outputs are robustly predicted by compact nonlinear mappings of sensory inputs. Thus, we impose no human intuitions (anthropomorphic bias) on what a robot control mode should be, but use nonlinear statistical techniques to discover them from direct task demonstration.    Within this context, in order to learn what a mode is, we need regression and classification models that give point specific estimates of how good a prediction is. We present such a framework where classifiers yield C(X) and P(C(X) = True Class | X) for instance X, and regression models yield R(X) and Pr(y_1 < y_true < y_2 | X) for instance X and user specified y_1 and y_2. Our approach makes minimal distribution assumptions, with no specific distributions (e.g. Gaussian, etc) assumed. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms commonly used algorithms in probability estimates, while still maintaining state of the art regression and classification accuracy.    Finally, I will describe our cyclic two stage process for learning sensor to actuator mappings for end-to-end robot task learning. The first stage, called the Supervised Learning stage, involves a human operator demonstrating the task via teleoperation, thereby generating a sequence of sensor input to actuator output pairs. These input output pairs are sent to a supervised learning algorithm, which builds a set of modes approximating the human's control strategy. This learned mode-switching controller is passed to the second stage, the Reinforcement Learning stage, which autonomously updates the mode boundaries to improve performance based on environment feedback. The learning process seamlessly cycles through these two stages, continually under human supervision. If the process is successful, the desired robot task is eventually learned by the robot and no further human intervention is needed. We consider the task learned when the success rate of the autonomous controller is similar to the performance of a human operator.

How do you coordinate simultaneous motion in an  optimal way? What is meant by "optimal" when each robot has distinct  goals and cost functions? We use vector-valued (or "Pareto")  optimization for collision-free coordination.                                                                                    Unfortunately, such optima are by no means unique: in fact, continua of  optimal coordinations are possible. We use methods inspired by geometric  group theory to identify a natural class of systems which have a finite  number of canonical optima. Surprisingly, abstract results about the  topology of cubical complexes aids greatly in the computation of these  optimal coordinations.

[Datebook] 9-4-2004  11:0 - 12:0  GRASP w/Ali  Levine Hall, Room 307  Dr. Larry Davis  University of Maryland    During the past decade, we have been studying problems related to detection, tracking and behavioral analysis of humans in action.  This talk will review that research, emphasizing our work on real time vision algorithms for visual surveillance.  The central tasks of a visual surveillance system are to detect objects (typically people and vehicles) that enter the surveillance site, build models for their appearance so that they can be tracked in both space and time, and model and recognize the interactions of people and vehicles with one another, with fixed objects in the environment and with objects that they transport and exchange.   Our research on detection has focused on background modeling and subtraction; I will describe the recently developed codebook algorithm for background modeling, and present a methodology for predicting the performance of background subtraction that is used both as a basis of comparison of our algorithm with others, as well as to identify parameters of the detection process from sample video. We have also developed methods for detecting people from a moving camera platform, and I will describe the components of that research. In the area of continuous tracking we have been studying methods that smoothly combine spatial and color/textural features within a particle filtering framework, and this work will be briefly presented. The persistent tracking problem involves recognizing that an object (person or vehicle) that was viewed previously is the same as an object being viewed now, possibly in another location or under different viewing conditions.  I will present a method to represent the color appearance of a person based on color path profiles that have some invariance to pose changes, and explain how they are used to address this persistent tracking problem.  Finally, a surveillance system needs methods for specifying the activities that it is to recognize.  Such a high level system must cope with uncertain results of image analysis and be able to control the application of vision operators to surveillance video to match models to observations.  I will describe an approach to this problem that we are pursuing using Petri nets.

[Datebook] 6-5-2004  14:0 - 15:0  Colloquium  Fred Douglis  IBM T.J. Watson Research Center    Ongoing advancements in technology lead to ever-increasing storage capacities. In spite of this, optimizing storage usage can still provide rich dividends. Several techniques based on delta-encoding and duplicate block suppression have been shown to reduce storage overheads, with varying requirements for resources such as computation and memory. We propose a new scheme for storage reduction that reduces data sizes with an effectiveness comparable to the more expensive techniques, but at a cost comparable to the faster but less effective ones. The scheme, called Redundancy Elimination at the Block Level (REBL), leverages the benefits of compression, duplicate block suppression, and delta-encoding to eliminate a broad spectrum of redundant data in a scalable and efficient manner. REBL also uses super-fingerprints, a technique that reduces the data needed to identify similar blocks and therefore the computational requirements of this process. As a result, REBL encodes more compactly than compression and duplicate suppression while executing faster than generic delta-encoding. For the data sets analyzed, REBL improved on the space reduction of other techniques by factors of 4-23 in the best case.

[Datebook] 1-10-2004  14:30 - 15:30   CS talk  Bharat Bhargava  Department of Computer Science  Purdue University    Friday, Oct. 1, 2004, 2:30PM  University Crossings 153    Abstract    Lack of trust, privacy, security, and reliability impedes information  sharing among distributed entities. My research work focuses on the  creation of knowledge and learning in secure networking, systems, and  applications. The fundamental research problems include: intruder  identification, trust management, privacy preserved interactions, and  dealing with a variety of attacks and frauds. The integrated results  will provide guidelines for the design and deployment of security  sensitive applications in the next generation networks.    In this talk, I will present intruder identification in AODV protocol  for establishing routes. By monitoring the routing information, attacks  such as false destination sequence numbers are detected. A protocol  called RLR (Reverse Labeling Restriction) is presented to identify and  isolate the malicious hosts in ad hoc networks. RLR traces back the  propagation paths of false routing information through reverse labeling.  Model of trust management can be employed in RLR. The mobile hosts reach  consistent conclusions on malicious hosts by combining local decisions  with knowledge from other hosts. We simulate RLR using ns2. The  simulation results show that up to 95% of the normal hosts can  successfully identify all attackers. Isolating the malicious hosts  through rejecting routing information from them causes a 30% increase in  the data delivery ratio. Two parameters, namely, host mobility and the  number of independent malicious hosts, are selected to study the  effectiveness, accuracy, and overhead of RLR in different network  environments. The robustness analysis shows that RLR does not introduce  additional vulnerabilities. We believe that RLR can be easily ported to  other ad hoc network routing protocols. We are extending this research  to deal with collaborative attacks. Congestion avoidance, wormhole  attacks, authentication, and privacy are being studied for routing  protocols.

Several previous attempts to provide a useful pen-based  interface for mathematics, however, have not succeeded. This talk  describes our approach to this problem. We identify a number of  independent, interesting sub-problems including mathematical symbol  recognition and dictionary-based disambiguation. We conclude with  a discussion of how pen-based mathematics may affect the course of  computer algebra systems.

[Datebook] 22-10-2004  14:0 - 15:0  CS talk  Speaker: Doug DeCarlo  Rutgers University  Department of Computer Science  Center for Cognitive Science    Time: October 22, 2:00-3:00 pm  Location: UCross 153    Abstract:    I will describe two ongoing projects that seek to produce  easily-perceived imagery using new theories in cognitive science  that relate artistic images to realistic images through our  understanding of human visual perception. Much of this talk will  focus on a new computational approach for making convincing  line-drawings of three-dimensional shapes. It goes beyond occluding  contours (which include the silhouette) and creases, and relies on a  new class of lines: suggestive contours. Suggestive contours are  lines on the surface that become true contours in nearby viewpoints;  they turn out to be located at certain view-dependent inflections of  the surface. Suggestive contours convey much richer information  about shape than contours can alone, yet they do so in a way that  harmonizes with the contours. Supported by a range of examples,  I'll discuss the mathematical properties of suggestive contours,  their perceptual implications, and their computational realization.    BIO:    Doug DeCarlo received BS degrees in computer science and computer  engineering from Carnegie Mellon in 1991, and his PhD in computer  science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. He is  currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer  Science with a joint appointment in the Center for Cognitive Science  at Rutgers University.    His research in computer graphics explores how accounts of human  perception and communication can inform the design of computer  systems that engage in effective visual communication.

[Datebook] 2-11-2004  15:0 - 16:30  Madhu Sudan talk, Penn  List decoding of error-correcting codes  Wu & Chen Auditorium  Levine Hall    The task of dealing with errors (or correcting them) lies at the  very heart of communication and computation.  The mathematical foundations for this task were laid in two  concurrent and interdependent works by Shannon and Hamming in the  late 1940s. The two theories are strikingly powerful and distinct  in their modelling of the error. Shannon's theory models errors  as effected by some probabilistic/stochastic process, while Hamming  envisions them as being introduced by an adversary. While the two  theories share a lot in the underlying tools, the quantitative  results are sharply diverging. Shannon's theory shows that a  channel that corrupts (arbitrarily) close to 50% of the transmitted  bits can still be used for transmission of information.    Hamming's theory in contrast has often been interpreted  to suggest it can handle at most 25% error on a binary channel.  So what can we do if an adversary is given the power to introduce  more than 25% errors? Can we protect information against this, or  do we just have to give up? The notion of list-decoding addresses  precisely this question, and shows that under a relaxed notion  of "decoding" (or recovering from errors), the quantitative gaps  between the Shannon and Hamming theories can be bridged. In this  talk, we will describe this notion and some recent algorithmic  developments.

The root of the problem is that algorithms are usually  analyzed in one of two ways: by worst-case or average-case analysis.  The former can improperly suggest that an algorithm will perform  poorly, while the latter can be unconvincing because the random inputs  it considers may fail to resemble those encountered in practice.  We introduce smoothed analysis to help explain the success of some of  these algorithms and heuristics. Smoothed analysis is a hybrid of  worst-case and average-case analyses that inherits advantages of both.  The smoothed complexity of an algorithm is the maximum over its inputs  of the expected running time of the algorithm under slight random  perturbations of that input. The smoothed complexity is then measured  as a function of both the input length and the magnitude of the  perturbations. If an algorithm has low smoothed complexity, then it  should perform well on most inputs in every neighborhood of inputs.  Smoothed analysis makes sense for algorithms whose inputs are subject  to slight amounts of noise in their low-order digits, which is  typically the case if they are derived from measurements of real-world  phenomena.    In this talk, I discuss how smoothed analysis can help explain  the excellent observed behavior of the simplex method for linear  programming, and provide an overview of other algorithms  to which it has been applied.

However, it is not clear how to obtain the  random bits necessary in a secure manner. In particular, one problem  is that in general, we can *not* rely on data sampled from nature to be  distributed according to a "nice" distribution (such as the  uniform distribution). In this talk, I will survey  some of the approaches to solving this problem in theory and practice  (with an emphasis on the former).

[Datebook] 11-11-2004  14:0 - 15:0  Eitan Grinspun talk  Multiresolution and Discrete Models as Foundations for Physical Simulation  Columbia University    Our research draws on ideas from graphics, geometry, applied math and  simulation to form elegant representations of physical systems. We  present two significant contributions, Multiresolution Simulation and  Discrete Models, which demonstrate that elegance in computational models  often leads to more geometric insight, wider adoption and the  opportunity to pursue more ambitious applications to mechanical  engineering, medicine, biology, and computer graphics without  sacrificing accuracy or performance.    Multiresolution Simulation is a general, elegant framework for adaptive  solvers, with applications to efficient simulations of large datasets  with high geometric complexity. Although adaptive solvers can  significantly reduce the computational cost of simulations, building  such solvers has been a daunting task. The framework we present  removes a number of implementation headaches associated with earlier  approaches and is a general technique independent of domain dimension  (e.g., 2D and 3D), element type (e.g., triangle, quad), and  approximation order. We demonstrate the versatility of this new approach  via applications to medical imaging, surgical assistance, and mechanical  engineering.    Discrete Models are geometric descriptions of physical phenomena  distilled into a discrete, coordinate-invariant form. This exciting,  emerging field promises to shed new geometric light on complex  physical phenomena. As a motivating case study, we present Discrete  Shells, a  reformulation of the equations governing the behavior of  thin, flexible objects ("shells"). Our novel model significantly reduces  the implementation hurdle for shell simulations, making such simulations  finally accessible to the graphics community, which has traditionally  shied away from shells. To conclude we present plans and a unifying  vision for future endeavors.

Penn    Title:  Online Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms    Abstract:  I'll provide some competitive online bounds for a number of Bayesian  algorithms, without making any assumptions on the data generation process.  These bounds show that some of the most popular Bayesian algorithms (such  as least squares regression and Bayesian logistic regression) perform  favorably when compared, in retrospect, to the single best model in the  model class.  I'll also provide bounds for some widely used maximum a  posteriori (MAP) estimation algorithms, including regularized logistic  regression.    Finally, I'll present some results (on work in progress) on online bounds  for Gaussian Processes. The bound here have an interesting dependence on  an intrinsic notion of dimensionality.

[Datebook] 12-11-2004  11:0 - 12:0  GRASP Seminar  End-to-End Training of Energy-Based Models with               Applications to Vision and Robotics  307 Levine Hall    Professor Yann LeCun  New York University    ABSTRACT:  Probabilistic graphical models associate a (normalized) probability for  each configuration of the variables to be predicted. Ensuring proper  normalization justifies many popular learning techniques (e.g. maximum  likelihood), but sometimes leads to computational intractabilities.    By contrast, energy-based models (EBM) merely associate an energy to  each configuration of the variables, eliminating the need for proper  normalization.  One can view the energy function as a measure of  "compatibility" between the values of the observed variables, the  variables to be predicted, and the latent variables.  Performing an  inference consists in comparing the energies associated with various  configurations of non-observed variables and choosing the configuration  with the smallest energy.    Using EBMs circumvents the requirement to normalize the models and  compute partition functions that may be intractable, but it requires the  use of loss functions that appropriately "carve" the energy landscape so  as to place minima at desired locations. We present a large family of  suitable loss functions, within which traditional loss functions, such  as negative log-likelihood, form a small subset.    We show how the EBM framework can be used to build large-scale vision  systems that can be trained end-to-end, from raw pixel images to  ultimate outputs.  We will describe, show videos, and run real-time live  demos of various vision application of end-to-end EBM training.  This will include:    - a real-time system for simultaneously detecting human faces    in images and estimating their pose.    - a mobile robot that was trained to emulate a human driver so    as to avoid obstacles in natural environment solely from    stereo image pairs.    - A real-time system for detecting and recognizing generic objects    such as vehicles, people, airplanes, and animals, with full    invariance to pose, illumination, and clutter.    Parts of this work are joint with Fu Jie Huang (NYU), Leon Bottou  (NEC), Rita Osadchy (NEC), and Matt Miller (NEC).

[Datebook] 15-11-2004  12:0 - 13:0  Asymptotic Zero Distributions for Polynomials  tea/coffee: 11:45  Korman 247    Bob Boyer, Drexel Math    Recently several researchers discovered that many natural sequences  of polynomials have interesting limiting sets of zeros in the  complex plane as their degrees go to infinity.  These observations have been both empirical as well as rigorous.  In some sense,  new "limits laws" are needed  that will explain the  nature and possible behaviors of such limiting sets.    In recent work with Bill Goh, we have determined the limiting curve  and distribution of zeros for the Euler and Bernoulli polynomials.  This curve is related to the Szego curve, the limiting curve for the  Taylor polynomials of the exponential.  As time permits, I will  also discuss open problems from combinatorics and graph theory.

The grand tour is a  family of computer-graphical methods that enable one to "take a tour" of  the data (a set of n points in p-space) by looking at it from "many  different  "directions".  Here we discuss the basic idea and the topology and  differential geometry behind these methods, as well as some details of how  they can be implemented.

Upon seeing a 10x10 pixel  image, we can recognize a person's face and even his expression.  How  do we do it?  Biological evidence suggests human memory plays an  important role in recognition task, capable storing and retrieving vast  number of objects and events.    In this talk, we outline three research projects on object and event  recognition: 1) Find unusual events in video; 2) Seeing and tracking  through water; 3) Learnable shape recognition and segmentation.    We demonstrate a data centric, memory based recognition approach for  these problems.    Our algorithms have two simple steps: 1) detecting patterns and  underlying structures of natural images and events; 2) constructing  recognition algorithm utilizing low dimension nature of images/events  structure.  Computationally, we show that graph-embedding/partitioning  techniques are powerful tools to use in these problems.

[Datebook] 18-1-2005  10:30 - 11:30  ECE job talk  Hill Conference Room    Kurt R. Rohloff  Coordinated Science Laboratory  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign    Abstract:    When designing a controller for a system, an engineer may be given a  choice of selecting which system behaviors could be observed by the  controller through the proper choice of sensors.  Due to reasons of  economy and simplicity it may be desired that a controller use as few  sensors as possible. This talk will discuss the sensor selection  problem in a relatively simple discrete-event systems (DES) framework  where the system behavior can be modeled with a finite-state machine.  In order to facilitate discussion on this problem a brief  introduction to discrete-event systems and computational complexity  will be given. In the DES framework the problem of selecting the  optimal set of sensors is NP complete.  However, many NP-complete  optimization problems have provably good approximation algorithms.  Several heuristic approximation algorithms have been developed to  solve the sensor selection problem, but it is relatively easy to find  important problem instances where these approximation methods fail  miserably.  It is shown that the sensor-selection problem most likely  has no provably good approximation methods.  However, based on the  proof of the inapproximability result, an intuitive approximation  algorithm can be developed that is very effective in practice for  this problem.

Sooner or later she will end up in        the southwest corner, and whoever moved her there is declared        the winner. Do you want to move first, or should you let your        adversary take the initiative?

In the Geometry        of Sumsets, we deduce properties of $A$ from properties of        $2A$, e.g., if $|2A|=2|A|-1$, then $A$ is an arithmetic        progression. I will outline the big problems in this area,        how my work fits into the big picture, and why harmonic        analysts care.          For example, one problem of importance (Sidon's problem) is        to describe $A$ under the assumption that $|2A| \geq c |A|^2$        for some $c$ (the description should depend on $c$). If $A        \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, then $|A|$ cannot be too large.        Recent progress on the question of ``how large'' relies on        finite field arithmetic and on the harmonic analysis result:        any subset of [0,1) with Lebesgue measure $\epsilon$ contains        a centrally symmetric subset with measure $0.59 \epsilon^2$.

[Datebook] 28-1-2005  14:0 - 15:0  CS talk (Hill)  Hill Conference Room (240 LeBow)    Demetri Terzopoulos,  New York University    Abstract:    The confluence of virtual reality and artificial life, an emerging  discipline that spans the computational and biological sciences, has  yielded synthetic worlds inhabited by realistic, artificial flora and  fauna. Artificial animals are complex synthetic organisms that possess  functional biomechanical bodies, perceptual sensors, and brains with  locomotion, perception, behavior, learning, and cognition centers.  Artificial humans and other animals are of interest in computer  graphics because they are self-animating graphical characters that can  dramatically advance the state of the art of production animation and  interactive game technologies. More broadly, these biomimetic autonomous  agents in their realistic virtual worlds also foster deeper,  computationally oriented insights into living systems.      Bio:    Demetri Terzopoulos holds the Lucy and Henry  Moses Professorship in  Science at New York University and is Professor of Computer Science and  Mathematics at NYU's Courant Institute. He is also affiliated with the  University of Toronto, where he is Professor of Computer Science and  Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He graduated from  McGill University and received the PhD degree (EECS) from MIT in 1984.  Prior to becoming an academic in 1989, he had been a program leader in  Schlumberger corporate research labs in California and Texas. His  published work comprises more than 250 research papers and several  volumes, primarily in computer graphics, computer vision, medical  imaging, computer-aided design, artificial intelligence, and artificial  life. He has given hundreds of invited talks around the world, including  numerous distinguished lectures and keynote addresses. A Fellow of the  IEEE, Professor Terzopoulos has been a Killam Fellow of the Canada  Council for the Arts, a Steacie Fellow of the Natural Sciences and  Engineering Research Council of Canada, a Fellow of the Canadian  Institute for Advanced Research, and a Senior Fellow at UCLA's Institute  for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). His many honors include  computer graphics awards from Ars Electronica, NICOGRAPH, Computers and  Graphics, and the  International Digital Media Foundation, and computer vision awards from  the IEEE, the Canadian Image Processing & Pattern Recognition Society,  the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, and the  International Medical  Informatics Association. Terzopoulos is the conference co-chair of the  2005 ACM/Eurographics Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) and was  program co-chair of Pacific Graphics 2004 and the 1998 IEEE Conference  on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). He has been a  founding editorial board member of journals spanning the vision,  graphics, medical imaging, and applied math fields.

TimeSearcher is an information visualization tool that uses  rectangular visual queries - known as "timeboxes" - to specify  constraints on linear sequences. TimeSearcher provides rapid, dynamic  query responses (< 100ms) to help users interactively explore  collections of these sequences. These tools have been applied to two  problems in bioinformatics: the use of time course microarray data to  develop hypotheses regarding regulatory behavior of genes, and the use  of aligned sequence frequencies to identify weak splicing  signals. Extensions to the timebox model that provide increased  expressivity will be presented, along with surprising results of an  analysis of search algorithm performance.

This is a truly formidable engineering  dream. The first steps involve creating devices that implement the  basic quantum logic gates necessary as building blocks for a largescale  quantum computer. The fascinating quantum physics underlying these  devices can be understood with remarkably simple but powerful models.  Using simulations of the controlled quantum evolution of few qubit  circuits, I will show how to physically implement quantum logic, and I  will discuss some of the challenges that must be met to achieve  large-scale and high-fidelity quantum logic. Whether these challenges  can be met is unknown, but in the meantime, experiments on prototype  qubits are probing the limits of quantum mechanics, including the  fundamental question of whether the macroscopic world is governed by  quantum laws.

In particular: we have developed new computer vision algorithms  that can  track dozens of interacting animals simultaneously; we use Markov  modeling techniques to recognize social behavior; and we use behavior  based controllers to build executable models of animal behavior based on  observation.  We have applied our research to the study of live ant and  bee colonies in our lab and monkeys at the Yerkes Primate Research  Center.

Chaotic flows exhibit sensitivity  to initial conditions and generate strange attractors.  We have responded to experimental requirements to develop  an analysis and classification scheme for strange attractors.  In the past decade we have developed a classification scheme for  low-dimensional strange attractors --- strange attractors  with Lyapunov dimension $d_L < 3$.  There are four levels of structure in this classification:  (1) basis sets of orbits; (2) branched manifolds; (3)  bounding tori; and (4) embeddings into $R^3$.  All four levels involve links of knots in very powerful ways.  We describe these four levels of structure in this presentation.

[Datebook] 28-4-2005  14:0 - 15:0  CS colloq  Frank Lee  Theoretical and methodological considerations for investigating  how humans learn complex and dynamic tasks.    Abstract:  Cognitive scientists have learned a great deal about the nature of human  skill acquisition from observing how people learn using simple  laboratory-based tasks. The most well known of these is the  empirically-derived behavioral law called the power law of practice,  which states that the trajectory of human learning closely mirrors a  power function. More recently cognitive scientists have begun to extend  their investigations to more complex and dynamic tasks while also taking  advantage of new methodologies like eye-movements and brain imaging.  However, while we have been getting impressive and interesting results  using more complex and dynamic tasks and using new methodologies, it is  less clear what the relationship is between these current results and  the past body of theoretical work on human skill acquisition, like the  power law of practice. In my talk, I will present a theoretical and  methodological approach that attempts to bridge these two divide. In  particular, I will argue that the proposed approach can particularly be  used as a foundation for current research into how humans learn complex  and dynamic tasks using brain imaging.

Methods  and ideas of these works proved to be very important in the development of  many branches of Analysis. During the last decade there have been very  substantial progress in this field, culminating in a solution of several old  problems (Fefferman, Bierstone-Milman-Pawlucki, speaker,  Brudnyi-Shvartsman). In the talk we shall discuss main results and some new  ideas which have led to these breakthroughs.

In the second part, I  will show that every positive definite operator-valued function on words  of length <= m of the free group with n generators can be extended to a  positive definite function on the whole group. Several related results  will also be presented, including factorization of positive polynomials  in noncommutative variables.

[Datebook] 6-5-2005  14:0 - 15:0  CS colloq  Expressive Volume Rendering    Penny Rheingans  University of Maryland Baltimore County    Abstract:    Accurately and automatically conveying the structure of a volume model  is a problem not fully solved by existing volume rendering approaches.  Physics-based volume rendering approaches create images which may match  the appearance of translucent materials in nature, but may not embody  important structural details. Transfer function approaches allow  flexible design of the volume appearance, but generally require  substantial hand tuning for each new data set in order to be effective.  We have introduced the volume illustration approach, combining the  familiarity of a physics-based illumination model with the ability to  enhance important features using non-photorealistic rendering  techniques. Since features to be enhanced are defined on the basis of  higher-order model characteristics rather than volume sample value, the  application of volume illustration techniques requires less manual  tuning than the design of a good transfer function. Volume illustration  provides a flexible unified framework for enhancing structural  perception of volume models through the amplification of features, the  addition of illumination effects, and the application of procedural  textures.    Volume illustration works on both presampled and procedurally defined  volume models, enabling a range of image styles from practical technical  illustrations to more abstract painterly effects. I will first present  some techniques from painting and technical illustration for conveying  shape and depth, particularly those relevant for translucent subjects.  After that, I will describe the volume illustration approach and present  some results from this new investigation.

[Datebook] 10-5-2005  15:30 - 16:30  Math colloquium  Combinatorics of overpartitions    Sylvie Corteel, CNRS PRiSM, Universite de Versailles    An overpartition of n is a non increasing sequence  of integers that sum to n where the last occurrence  of an integer can be overlined. They are a generalization  of partitions which is a classical combinatorial object  studied by Euler and then, among others, Sylvester,  Ramanujan, Mac Mahon, and Andrews. Like partitions, overpartitions have  some  amazing properties and connections with several branches of mathematics:  combinatorics, basic hypergeometric series, number theory,  representation theory, mathematical physics ...  The story of overpartitions is just starting. They were defined to  understand  the combinatorics of basic hypergeometric identities. But different  approaches now show that classical results on partitions are special  cases of results on overpartitions.  I will focus on combinatorial properties  of overpartitions and will survey some recent and ongoing  work with Lovejoy (CNRS), Yee (Penn State), Mallet (Versailles),  Hitczenko (Drexel), and Goh (Drexel).

[Datebook] 12-5-2005  15:30 - 16:30  math colloq  Partitions and Compositions Defined by Inequalities    Abstract:  In this talk we focus on techniques for enumerating  nonnegative integer solutions to a set of linear inequalities,  with a focus on applications to the theory of partitions  and compositions.  Examples include plane partitions,  lecture hall partitions, Cayley compositions, anti-lecture  hall compositions, and Euler-type partition identities.    We propose some elementary techniques which have been  surprisingly successful at giving simpler proofs of  known results and, so far, modestly successful at giving  new results.

[Datebook] 1-9-2005  14:0 - 15:0  Virtual Internet  Bossone 303  Joe Touch  Abstract:    Virtual Internets (VIs) are emerging as a useful tool for managing  shared testbed infrastructure, as well as supporting emerging protocols  and systems. This talk presents the principles of our Virtual Internet  Architecture, and examines its impact on the architecture of end  systems, routers, and protocols. The talk also summarizes related  research exploring the capabilities of VIs and augmenting system  capabilities to support VIs. This includes: the X- Bone system for  automated VI deployment and management; the DynaBone system for  fault-tolerance and performance via multi-layer virtualization; the  NetFS system for providing compartmentalized configuration of network  resources; and the DataRouter system for supporting application-directed  peer networks via a network-layer string rewriting mechanism. We discuss  efforts underway to deploy a persistent, global X-Bone for collaborative  network experiments, and steps that take a VI into a new Communicating  System for the future.    The talk will also very briefly note some concurrent efforts, including  an all-optical IP router, high-performance zero- configuration security,  and "smart-start" TCP.    Biography:    Joseph D. Touch is Director of the Postel Center in the Computer  Networks Division of USC's Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and a  research associate professor in USC's CS and EE Depts. He received a  B.S. with Honors in biophysics and CS from the Univ. of Scranton in  1985, an M.S. in CS from Cornell Univ. in 1987, and a Ph.D. in CS from  the Univ. of Pennsylvania in 1992. He joined ISI in 1992, and his  current projects include automatic networks, virtual networks (NetFS,  X-Tend), usable security, and optical Internets. His research interests  include Internet protocols, network architecture, high-speed &  low-latency nets, network device design, and experimental network  analysis. He is co-author of a high-speed networks book and chapters on  Internet architecture and overlay networks. Joe is a member of Sigma Xi,  IEEE, and ACM, and is currently ACM SIGCOMM's Conference Coordinator,  IEEE Infocom 2006 PC Chair, member of numerous conference steering and  program committees, and is active in the IETF. He also serves on the  editorial boards of IEEE Network and Computer Networks.

[Datebook] 8-9-2005  15:0 - 16:0  Principles of Embedded Computation  Rajeev Alur, CIS Faculty  Wu & Chen Auditorium, Levine Hall    Classical models of computation such as automata and Turing machines  capture the discrete functional dependency among inputs and outputs,  but abstract the real-time properties. These models consequently are  not adequate for embedded systems such as automotive controllers and  robots that consist of discrete software interacting with the  continuous physical world. In this talk, we will review the models of  timed and hybrid automata and the associated theory of embedded  computation. We will discuss the project CHARON, issues related to  correct implementation of embedded control models, and directions for  future research.

[Datebook] 9-9-2005  11:0 - 12:0  GRASP  Bob Full  Berkeley    Bipedal Bugs, Galloping Ghosts and Gripping Geckos: BioInspired Robotics, Artificial Muscles and Adhesives    Wu & Chen Auditorium, Levine Hall    Abstract: The Age of Interdisciplinary Integration is upon us. Integrative biology is providing inspiration to disciplines such as animatronics, animation, mathematics, medicine, robotics and space exploration. In return, these disciplines supply biologists with novel design hypotheses, algorithms and measurement devices. One example is in the area of BioMotion. Comparing the remarkable diversity in nature has lead to the discovery of general principles. Animals are amazing at legged locomotion because they have simple control systems, multifunctional actuators and feet that allow no surface to be an obstacle. Extraordinarily diverse animals show the same dynamics - legged animals appear to bounce like people on pogo sticks. Force patterns produced by six-legged insects are the same as those produced by trotting eight-legged crabs, four-legged dogs  and even running humans. Rapid running cockroaches can become bipedal as they take 50 steps in a single second and ghost crabs seem to glide with aerial phases. Yet, the advantage of many legs and a sprawled posture appears to be in stability. Mathematical models show that these designs self-stabilize to perturbations without the equivalent of a brain. Control algorithms appear embedded in the form of the animal itself. Muscles tune the system by acting as motors, springs, struts and shocks all in one. Amazing feet permit creatures such as geckos to climb up walls at over meter per second without using glue or suction - just molecular forces. These fundamental principles of animal locomotion have inspired the design of creations in computer animation (A Bug's Life, Pixar), new control circuits, artificial muscles, self-clearing dry adhesives, and autonomous legged robots such as the Mecho-gecko, Sprawl, RHex and RiSE that may someday go to Mars. Revolutionary technological advances in materials and manufacturing promise to make nature a better teacher.    http://www.grasp.upenn.edu/seminar/AY-2005/Bob_Full.html

[Datebook] 17-10-2005  14:0 - 15:0  Math colloquium  Victor Vinnikov  Matrix Convexity  Korman 247, at 2:00    Abstract: An old theorem of Ando states that if a real polynomial p(x)  in one variable is matrix convex, meaning that          p(t X + (1-t) Y) \leq t p(X) + (1-t) p(Y)    for all real symmetrix matrices X,Y (of any size) and any t in [0,1],  then p(x) has degree at most two. I will present a similar result for  polynomials in several noncommuting variables. I will discuss the ideas  behind the proof of this result, which involve noncommutative  derivatives and noncommutative realization theory.

Strambach (joint work with A.Heinze)    Mikhael Klin  Ben Gurion University  Korman 247    Abstract:    Starting from a computer generated example of a Latin square graph over  a proper loop, which admits a regular automorphism group, we describe a  computer free interpretation of this specific strongly regular graph.  Moreover, with this interpretation we were able to generalize the  result to an infinite series of similar examples.

[Datebook] 28-10-2005  11:0 - 12:0  GRASP brain talk  Jean-Jacques Slotine  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Modularity, Synchronization, and the Brain  307 Levine Hall    Abstract: Although neurons as computational elements are 7 orders of  magnitude slower than their artificial counterparts, the primate brain  grossly outperforms robotic algorithms in all but the most structured  tasks. Parallelism alone is a poor explanation, and much recent functional  modelling of the central nervous system focuses on its modular, heavily  feedback-based computational architecture, the result of accumulation of  subsystems throughout evolution. We discuss this architecture from a global  stability and convergence point of view. We then study synchronization as a  model of computations at different scales in the brain, such as pattern  matching, temporal binding of sensory data, and mirror neuron response.  Finally, we derive a simple condition for a general dynamical system to  globally converge to a regime where multiple groups of fully synchronized  elements coexist. Applications of such "polyrhythms" to some classical  questions in systems neuroscience and robotics are discussed.    The development makes extensive use of nonlinear contraction theory, a  comparatively recent anaysis tool whose main features will be reviewed.    Biography: Jean-Jacques Slotine is Professor of Mechanical Engineering and  Information Sciences, Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and  Director of the Nonlinear Systems Laboratory at M.I.T.

[Datebook] 16-11-2005  14:0 - 15:0  Math Colloq  Greg Nabor  Korman 247    LOCALIZATION AND STATIONARY PHASE APPROXIMATION    Abstract:  The Residue Theorem expresses the contour integral  of a complex-valued function f(z) around a closed curve C as  a sum of contributions from the singularities of f(z) inside C,  i.e., it localizes the integral to the singular set.  A similar  phenomenon occurs when the stationary phase (or saddle point)  pproximation of a function happens to be exact.  Oddly enough,  this happens often enough to warrant attention and, when due  attention is paid, one uncovers a beautiful series of Localization  Theorems which show that the secret to the exactness of the  stationary phase approximation is to be found in topology  (specifically, in equivariant cohomology).  As they are wont  to do, the physicists have appropriated these theorems for use  in their infinite-dimensional world of supersymmetry and path  integrals, where they cease to be theorems at all, of course.  But never mind. The results are spectacular and we will have a  brief look.

These requirements can lead to very complicated algorithms; so much so that  it can be difficult to verify correctness. I will give an overview of the  ideas and issues that arise when constructing algorithms to solve the  meshing problem, and will indicate how the mesh generation problem touches  on many areas of mathematics and computer science such as  approximation/interpolation theory, computational geometry, sphere packing,  graph theory, and algorithm design.

[Datebook] 9-11-2006  15:0 - 16:15  James Larus: Singularity  James Larus: Singularity: Rethinking the Software Stack    Wu & Chen Auditorium  101 Levine Hall    Singularity is a research project in Microsoft Research that started  with the question: what would software look like if it were designed  from scratch with an emphasis on dependability and robustness? We are  trying to answer this question by building on modern programming  languages and tools to develop a new system architecture and operating  system (named Singularity). The resulting system differs from other  systems in a number of respects. It is written almost entirely in a  safe programming language (C#) and it does not rely on hardware for  process isolation. These design choices led to a system architecture  that is more resilient and that supports specification and  verification at many levels of abstraction.

[Memo] Jacques Brel, Amsterdam  	  Paroles et Musique: Jacques Brel   1964  "Olympia 64"  autres interprètes: Isabelle Boulay, Thierry Amiel (2003)       Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui chantent  Les rêves qui les hantent  Au large d'Amsterdam  Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui dorment  Comme des oriflammes  Le long des berges mornes  Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui meurent  Pleins de bière et de drames  Aux premières lueurs  Mais dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui naissent  Dans la chaleur épaisse  Des langueurs océanes    Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui mangent  Sur des nappes trop blanches  Des poissons ruisselants  Ils vous montrent des dents  A croquer la fortune  A décroisser la lune  A bouffer des haubans  Et ça sent la morue  Jusque dans le cœur des frites  Que leurs grosses mains invitent  A revenir en plus  Puis se lèvent en riant  Dans un bruit de tempête  Referment leur braguette  Et sortent en rotant    Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui dansent  En se frottant la panse  Sur la panse des femmes  Et ils tournent et ils dansent  Comme des soleils crachés  Dans le son déchiré  D'un accordéon rance  Ils se tordent le cou  Pour mieux s'entendre rire  Jusqu'à ce que tout à coup  L'accordéon expire  Alors le geste grave  Alors le regard fier  Ils ramènent leur batave  Jusqu'en pleine lumière    Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Y a des marins qui boivent  Et qui boivent et reboivent  Et qui reboivent encore  Ils boivent à la santé  Des putains d'Amsterdam  De Hambourg ou d'ailleurs  Enfin ils boivent aux dames  Qui leur donnent leur joli corps  Qui leur donnent leur vertu  Pour une pièce en or  Et quand ils ont bien bu  Se plantent le nez au ciel  Se mouchent dans les étoiles  Et ils pissent comme je pleure  Sur les femmes infidèles  Dans le port d'Amsterdam  Dans le port d'Amsterdam.

[Memo] Edith Piaf, L'Accordéoniste  Paroles et musique: Michel Emer, enr. déc. 1940, et 25 mai 1956      La fille de joie est belle  Au coin de la rue là-bas  Elle a une clientèle  Qui lui remplit son bas  Quand son boulot s'achève  Elle s'en va à son tour  Chercher un peu de rêve  Dans un bal du faubourg  Son homme est un artiste  C'est un drôle de petit gars  Un accordéoniste  Qui sait jouer la java    Elle écoute la java  Mais elle ne la danse pas  Elle ne regarde même pas la piste  Et ses yeux amoureux  Suivent le jeu nerveux  Et les doigts secs et longs de l'artiste  Ça lui rentre dans la peau  Par le bas, par le haut  Elle a envie de chanter  C'est physique  Tout son être est tendu  Son souffle est suspendu  C'est une vraie tordue de la musique    La fille de joie est triste  Au coin de la ru là-bas  Son accordéoniste  Il est parti soldat  Quand il reviendra de la guerre  Ils prendront une maison  Elle sera la caissière  Et lui, sera le patron  Que la vie sera belle  Ils seront de vrais pachas  Et tous les soirs pour elle  Il jouera la java    Elle écoute la java  Qu'elle fredonne tout bas  Elle revoit son accordéoniste  Et ses yeux amoureux  Suivent le jeu nerveux  Et les doigts secs et longs de l'artiste  Ça lui rentre dans la peau  Par le bas, par le haut  Elle a envie de pleurer  C'est physique  Tout son être est tendu  Son souffle est suspendu  C'est une vraie tordue de la musique    La fille de joie est seule  Au coin de la rue là-bas  Les filles qui font la gueule  Les hommes n'en veulent pas  Et tant pis si elle crève  Son homme ne reviendra plus  Adieux tous les beaux rêves  Sa vie, elle est foutue  Pourtant ses jambes tristes  L'emmènent au boui-boui  Où y a un autre artiste  Qui joue toute la nuit    Elle écoute la java...  ...elle entend la java  ...elle a fermé les yeux  ...et les doigts secs et nerveux...

[Memo] Selige Sehnsucht    Sagt es niemand, nur den Weisen,  Weil die Menge gleich verhöhnet,  Das Lebendge will ich preisen,  Das nach Flammentod sich sehnet.    In der Liebesnächte Kühlung,  Die dich zeutge, wo du zeugtest,  Überfallt dich fremde Fühlung,  Wenn die stille Kerze leuchtet.    Nicht mehr bleibest Du umfangen  In der Finsternis Beschattung,  Und dich reißet neu Verlangen  Auf zu höherer Begattung.    Keine Ferne macht dich schwiegig,  Kommst geflogen und gebannt,  Und zuletzt, des Lichts begierig,  Bist du Schmetterling verbrannt.    Und solang du das nicht hast,  Dieses: Stirb und werde!  Bist du nur ein trüber Gast  Auf der dunklen Erde.    - JWG
[Memo] Evangeline: A Tale of Arcadie     by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow    from the 1893 Cambridge Edition  (Originally published in 1847)    THIS is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,  Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,  Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,  Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.  Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean  Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.  This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it  Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman?  Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers --  Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,  Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?  Waste are those pleasant farms, and the farmers forever departed!  Scattered like dust and leaves, when the mighty blasts of October  Seize them, and whirl them aloft, and sprinkle them far o'er the ocean.  Naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of Grand-Pré.  Ye who believe in affection that hopes, and endures, and is patient,  Ye who believe in the beauty and strength of woman's devotion,  List to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest;  List to a Tale of Love in Acadie, home of the happy.

[Memo] The Song of Hiawatha    INTRODUCTION    Should you ask me, whence these stories?  Whence these legends and traditions,  With the odors of the forest  With the dew and damp of meadows,  With the curling smoke of wigwams,  With the rushing of great rivers,  With their frequent repetitions,  And their wild reverberations  As of thunder in the mountains?    I should answer, I should tell you,  "From the forests and the prairies,  From the great lakes of the Northland,  From the land of the Ojibways,  From the land of the Dacotahs,  From the mountains, moors, and fen-lands  Where the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,  Feeds among the reeds and rushes.  I repeat them as I heard them  From the lips of Nawadaha,  The musician, the sweet singer."    Should you ask where Nawadaha  Found these songs so wild and wayward,  Found these legends and traditions,  I should answer, I should tell you,  "In the bird's-nests of the forest,  In the lodges of the beaver,  In the hoof-prints of the bison,  In the eyry of the eagle!    "All the wild-fowl sang them to him,  In the moorlands and the fen-lands,  In the melancholy marshes;  Chetowaik, the plover, sang them,  Mahng, the loon, the wild-goose, Wawa,  The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,  And the grouse, the Mushkodasa!"    If still further you should ask me,  Saying, "Who was Nawadaha?  Tell us of this Nawadaha,"  I should answer your inquiries  Straightway in such words as follow.    "In the vale of Tawasentha,  In the green and silent valley,  By the pleasant water-courses,  Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.  Round about the Indian village  Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,  And beyond them stood the forest,  Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,  Green in Summer, white in Winter,  Ever sighing, ever singing.    "And the pleasant water-courses,  You could trace them through the valley,  By the rushing in the Spring-time,  By the alders in the Summer,  By the white fog in the Autumn,  By the black line in the Winter;  And beside them dwelt the singer,  In the vale of Tawasentha,  In the green and silent valley.    "There he sang of Hiawatha,  Sang the Song of Hiawatha,  Sang his wondrous birth and being,  How he prayed and how be fasted,  How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,  That the tribes of men might prosper,  That he might advance his people!"    Ye who love the haunts of Nature,  Love the sunshine of the meadow,  Love the shadow of the forest,  Love the wind among the branches,  And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,  And the rushing of great rivers  Through their palisades of pine-trees,  And the thunder in the mountains,  Whose innumerable echoes  Flap like eagles in their eyries;--  Listen to these wild traditions,  To this Song of Hiawatha!    Ye who love a nation's legends,  Love the ballads of a people,  That like voices from afar off  Call to us to pause and listen,  Speak in tones so plain and childlike,  Scarcely can the ear distinguish  Whether they are sung or spoken;--  Listen to this Indian Legend,  To this Song of Hiawatha!    Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,  Who have faith in God and Nature,  Who believe that in all ages  Every human heart is human,  That in even savage bosoms  There are longings, yearnings, strivings  For the good they comprehend not,  That the feeble hands and helpless,  Groping blindly in the darkness,  Touch God's right hand in that darkness  And are lifted up and strengthened;--  Listen to this simple story,  To this Song of Hiawatha!    Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles  Through the green lanes of the country,  Where the tangled barberry-bushes  Hang their tufts of crimson berries  Over stone walls gray with mosses,  Pause by some neglected graveyard,  For a while to muse, and ponder  On a half-effaced inscription,  Written with little skill of song-craft,  Homely phrases, but each letter  Full of hope and yet of heart-break,  Full of all the tender pathos  Of the Here and the Hereafter;--  Stay and read this rude inscription,  Read this Song of Hiawatha!

[Memo] Wem Gott will rechte Gunst    Wem Gott will rechte Gunst erweisen,  Den schickt er in die weite Welt,  Dem will er seine Wunder weisen  In Berg und Wald und Strom und Feld.    Die Trägen, die zu Hause liegen,  Erquicket nicht das Morgenrot,  Sie wissen nur vom Kinderwiegen,  Von Sorgen, Last und Not um Brot.    Die Bächlein von den Bergen springen,  Die Lerchen schwirren hoch vor Lust,  Was sollt' ich nicht mit ihnen singen  Aus voller Kehl' und frischer Brust.    Den lieben Gott laß' ich nur walten;  Der Bächlein, Lerchen, Wald und Feld  Und Erd' und Himmel will erhalten,  Hat auch mein' Sach' auf's best' bestellt.
