<h3>Subscribing and unsubscribing</h3>

<table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="13" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td>
    The easiest way for most people to subscribe or unsubscribe from
    mailing lists is with the web interface, linked below. The web
    interface calls itself majorcool.

    <p>
    Once you have clicked through to majorcool, Enter your email
    address and click on the "go" button below your email address.
    Check or uncheck the checkboxes and click either "apply" button
    (one above, one below).

    <p> If everything has gone well, you should get email in a few
    minutes confirming whatever you have done.

    <a href="https://list.purple.com/">list.purple.com</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p>
    If you don't have web access, you can do the same things with
    email.

    <p>
    Send mail to the <a
    href="mailto:majordomo@list.purple.com">purple</a> list server
	with a two line body. Line one should say "subscribe
    listname" or "unsubscribe listname". The second line should say
    "end". (Specify the list you mean.) Be aware, the list server
    administrative software that
    you are mailing to is
    unforgiving of typos.

<p> From time to time people express concern about privacy and the
list archive. Whether you can find your posts on the net or
not, you must assume any mail you send to a list (these or any others)
or on a web page may end up on the web or in a searchable place
somehow. The list administrator exerts no control over what people do
with list postings, and databases across the planet can subscribe
without anyone necessarily knowing that that is what is happening. If you
are worried that someone may see your post later, please don't post.

<p>
Just to be clear, though:

<p>
<table width="80%" border="1" align="center" cellpadding="10">
  <tr><td>
      By posting to any list hosted by purple.com, you
      consent that other people may repost or otherwise publish those
      emails you send to such lists, as long as such reposting or
      publishing is not for profit. You maintain copyright on your
      own work, you simply grant this one not-for-profit right to
      others.
  </td></tr>

<h3>Netiquette and Administrivia</h3>

<p> Please don't post overly long items.  Try to post text whenever
possible, providing a link to further content if you have an
attachment you think people should see. The list server enforces a 40K
limit per email, in any case.

<p> The list administrator is Jeff Abrahamson. If you send him mail
asking him to subscribe or unsubscribe you from a list at purple, he
will almost certainly delete your mail without replying to it. If you
have genuine trouble with the list, he would expect you to send him
mail documenting your problem, what you did, and why you believe you
have exhausted your recourse dealing with the automated systems for
maintaining your subscription. Many thousands of people manage to use
the automated subscription maintenance tools, most of them not
computer gurus.

<p> The <b>most common two reasons that people have trouble unsubscribing</b>
is not following the directions and not knowing what address they are
subscribed at. The second, especially, you just have to figure out
yourself, as no one can help you. If you have more than one address
that merges into one mailbox, you have to somehow figure out how you
subscribed. Did your company change name and keep forwarding your
mail? Do you have more than one account and some forward to others?

<p>
<b>Some lists occasionally become noisy</b> or delve for overly long periods
of time into subjects that may be of minimal interest to some
subscribers. It may be helpful to think of discussion on the lists as
you would discussion at a party. If you are not interested in the
discussion, don't listen (delete the mail). If you feel you will never
be interested again, leave (unsubscribe). But it probably will not be
productive to try to convince people that they should not talk if they
feel they have something to say.

<p> If the subscribers of a list mostly become uninterested in a
subject, they hopefully will ignore the subject, and posters on the
subject will quickly become silent as they perceive they have no
audience. If a lengthy exchange involves only two or three people,
those people hopefully will decide to take their exchange private if
it becomes clear that it is going on for a while and is of only
private interest.

<p> In particular, though, note that the list administrator is highly
unlikely to impose on others his own opinion of whether a topic is
going on too long or is off topic. In the exceedingly rare case that a
poster is genuinely spamming a list, he may intercede, but that has
happened precisely once in the long history of the lists managed by
him.

<p> You may find it helpful to use a mail client that has the ability
to filter incoming mail by criteria such as the list it is coming
from. Outlook appears to have such facility, although abundant
evidence suggests that Outlook poses security risks, primarly to its
users. Eudora, which is available for free as well as paid download,
also has these abilities. Both are available on both MacOS and
Windows. If you use linux, BSD, or other operating systems, you
probably want to check out something like procmail. You probably have
many other options besides these few mentioned here. But neither the
lists hosted here nor the list administrator is likely an appropriate
source of further information on how to use your mail system.

<p> <b>This list is mostly composed of individuals.</b> Unless someone
specifically states to the contrary, you should assume that they are
expressing their own opinion and not the opinion of any organization
to which they happen to belong or are employed by. In particular, many
peoples email clients add a text signature at the bottom without it
being particularly remarkable to the person sending the mail. You
probably shouldn't interpret that signature to suggest official
communication by their organization.
