	  <p>It's extremely rare that I do anything on the main bit of
	  <a href="http://purple.com/">purple.com </a> that talks
	  about me, so this page is a quick introduction.  You can go
	  away now, it's ok.  Just click <a
	  href="http://purple.com/purple.html">here</a> and you're
	  gone, I won't be offended.  To make it really clear that
	  this page is different, you'll notice that I've themed it
	  with orange css instead of the usual purple.css.  Even the
	  fonts are different.</p>

	  <h1>I'm teaching some courses</h1>

	  <p class="lead">I'm going to be teaching some public Machine
	  Learning and Big Data courses in the Bay area in March.</p>

	  <p>I'd love to have lots of people come join me.  I've given
	  some of these courses in London, and it's been quite
	  successful and a lot of fun for all involved.  (Well, people
	  said in the reviews that they had a good time and it was
	  worth it.  I believe them.)  Since I'm originally from the
	  States, I thought it would be fun to give it a try while
	  back home visiting.</p>

	  <p>Here's the quick summary:<p>

	  <ul>
	    
	    <li>These are <em>evening courses</em>, from 6 to 9 p.m.
	    I'd be up for doing day courses if anyone's company wants
	    to pay me to come in.  Day courses aren't my priority on
	    this trip, but I'm happy to do some if someone's
	    interested.  <a href="mailto:orange@purple.com">Email
	    me</a>.</li>
		
	    <li>These are <em>paid courses</em>.  Sorry, it's fun for
	    all involved, but it also takes a lot of time to prepare
	    and do well.  My day job is fun, but I insist that they
	    pay me, too.  If you're from the Bay area and you think I
	    missed some cultural clue, <a
	    href="mailto:orange@purple.com">do let me know</a>.</li>

	    <li>But you can <em>take them for free</em> if you get your company
	    to host the course. As long as we get enough people taking
	    the courses that the economics works out, you can invite
	    your co-workers, too, as long as (somewhat arbitrarily)
	    you don't outnumber the paying folks.</li>

	    <li>I'm using EventBrite for fulfillment, and they let me
	    set up <em>referral bonuses</em>.  So I've also set up a
	    referral bonus for people who aren't even taking the
	    courses.  Check out the "referral only" category on the
	    registration pages and then get all your Bay area friends
	    to come along.</li>
		
	  </ul>

	  <p>What will I be teaching?  Here's the list -- add "with
	  python and scikit-learn (and maybe OpenCV)" in each case.
	  </p>

	  <ul>
	    
	    <li>[<a

		target="_blank" style="color:#0000ff">Register</a>]
		<b>Face recognition.</b> How it works, what are the
		tricks and trade-offs. When it doesn't work so well
		and what to do about it.  We'll build one.</li>

		<b>Handwriting recognition.</b> How it works.  Tricks
		and trade-offs. When it doesn't work so well and what
		to do about it.  And then we'll build one.</li>

	    <b>Recommendation systems.</b> How they work, what are the
	    trade-offs. We'll build some of these, too.</li>

	    <li>[<a

		target="_blank" style="color:#0000ff">Register</a>]
		<b>Statistics and how to draw conclusions from
		data.</b> Probability and statistics are based on some
		rather simple concepts, although the mathematics has a
		reputation of annoying.  We'll talk about how to
		explore data sets and when it's probably meaningful
		(or not) to draw conclusions.</li>

	    <li>[<a
	    href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/neural-networks-an-introduction-and-what-the-hype-is-about-and-about-deep-learning-tickets-15325185041?ref=elink"
	    target="_blank" style="color:#0000ff">Register</a>]
	    <b>Neural networks.</b> What are they, are they
	    over-hyped?  (The answer to that one is "yes and no,
	    actually".) And then we'll build one.</li>

	  </ul>

	  <p>The idea with all of these courses is that you're
	  probably good at reading docs for software packages, but
	  getting the intuition down for complex machine learning
	  algorithms is harder.  There will be some math, but not
	  enough to scare those who don't like math.  We only have an
	  evening, not a semester, so we'll be aiming for
	  understanding what's going on so you can use this stuff at
	  work (or at home), not doing fundamental research and
	  authoring papers.</p>

	  <p>And now you can click on the registration links above to
	  read all the nitty details and (if you're completely
	  awesome) to sign up.</p>

	  <p>Thoughts or suggestions?  Drop me <a
	  href="mailto:orange@purple.com">mail</a>.  (I'll be unreachable
	  the week of 10 February, so if you email me then, I'll
	  respond when I'm back online.)</p>
