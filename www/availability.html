<h2>Purple.com Availability Guidelines</h2>

<p>&nbsp;

<h4>Purple.com is <u>not</u> for sale</h4>


<p>
We do use purple.com. We understand that those who are not technically
inclined nor in the know may not see that. That's ok. We don't think
any less of those who don't know our personal business.


<h4>Purple.com <u>is</u> available for lease or licensing</h4>

<p> For further information on any of these options, please email us.
<b>All numbers are either in GBP or in EUR, as you wish.</b> But if we
sign a contract, the currency is determined by whether we write the
contract under French or UK law.

<p>
<b>1. </b>You may place a text ad on the main purple page (<a
href="http://www.purple.com/index.html">http://www.purple.com/index.html</a>).
The cost is 100 per day for the first two words.  For longer ads, the
price is 100+100*(w-2)^2 per day.  I.e., 200 for three words, 500 for
four words, etc.  For images, the price is 0.10 per pixel per day.  So
an 88x31 tag (2728 pixels) would cost 272.80 per day.  We are
interested in the page loading quickly.

<p>The main page currently
redirects to blank purple after 2 seconds.  You may increase the delay
time for a daily price that is 20% of your ad price times the square of the
number of seconds you wish to add.

<p>
<b>2. </b> You may lease the single page (entry point)
<a href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a> at the
rate of 5000 per month. We would redirect that one page
to the (non-purple) address of your choice. Email addresses at purple
are available for 10 each per month if you are leasing the main entry
point.
<!-- You would have to put a comment like this in the first 24x80
 screen of html where we redirect, letting people know where they
 can find information about purple.com leasing. -->


<p>
<b>3. </b>
You may lease sub-domains of purple (other than www) for 1000
per month. You must host your own content: we merely point DNS at the
IP of your choice. For 100 per month additional you may handle all
email to your sub-domain of purple. Individual email addresses at purple or at
your sub-domain are otherwise available for 10 each per month.


<p> <b>4. </b> You may license all of purple.com, giving you the right
to put all of your content at www.purple.com, including hosting the
site itself. You would be required to maintain forwarding on certain
email addresses and redirects on a small number of URL's, but none
with names that should cause problems. The cost of licensing the
entire site is a one-time fee of 750,000 plus a monthly maintenance
fee of 100 which may be paid in advance annually.

<p> <b>5. </b> You may have an address at friends.purple.com for 50
per month. The address is licensed to you as long as you keep
paying. You may do anything you want with it except represent yourself
as having a relationship with purple.com other than leasing the
address or addresses you lease. You may not do anything that gets us
in legal trouble, and you may not use it as a spam return address. We
would forward that address to the address of your choice: we would not
offer actual storage.


<h4>Some questions and their answers</h4>

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
Why is this so expensive?


<p>
<b>A.</b>
To make my life simple.


<p>-

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
This is too expensive! Won't you bring the price down?


<p>
<b>A.</b>
The price is not negotiable. Everyone has different ideas of
expensive. If you feel this is too expensive, you are welcome to find
a less expensive domain name.


<p>-

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
What restrictions would I have on what I can do with my sub-domain of
purple?


<p>
<b>A.</b> We impose no restrictions, except that it must be legal, must
not get us in legal problems, can't be for purposes of spamming, etc.


<p>-

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
Can I have an email address without paying all those fees?


<p>
<b>A.</b>
No. That wouldn't be simple. (It doesn't scale.)


<p>-

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
Why is <a
href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a> nearly all
purple? Why does it link to a purple page?


<p>
<b>A.</b>
It makes my life simple.


<p>-

<p>
<b>Q.</b>
Isn't there more?


<p>
<b>A.</b>
No.


<p>-

    <p>
<b>Q.</b> I don't want to lease, I want to buy!

<p> <b>A.</b> Leasing is a fairly standard business structure.  In most
contexts you can achieve most of the rights you'd like from purchase
via lease, although you often have to enumerate what you want.  If you
really feel that leasing purple.com doesn't work for you and you don't
have a credible argument for why, understand that I will wonder what
you are up to.
