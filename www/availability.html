	<h2>Purple.com Availability Guidelines</h2>

	<h4>Purple.com is <u>not</u> for sale</h4>


	<p>We do use purple.com. We understand that those who are not
	    technically inclined nor in the know may not see
	    that. That's ok. We don't think any less of those who
	    don't know our personal business.</p>


	<h4>Purple.com <u>is</u> available for lease or licensing</h4>

	<p> For further information on any of these options, please
	    email us.<b>All numbers are either in GBP or in EUR, as
	    you wish.</b> But if we sign a contract, the currency is
	    determined by whether we write the contract under French
	    or UK law.</p>

	<p><b>1.  Advertising.</b>  You may place a text ad on the
	    main purple page (<a
href="http://www.purple.com/index.html">http://www.purple.com/index.html</a>).
	    See the <a
	    href="advertise.html">advertising</a> page for full
	    details.
	</p>

	<p>The main page currently redirects to blank purple after 2
	    seconds.  You may increase the delay time for a daily
	    price that is 20% of your ad price times the square of the
	    number of seconds you wish to add.</p>

	<p> <b>2.  Lease the root page.</b>  You may lease the single
	page (entry point) <a
	    href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a>
	    at the rate of 5000 per month. We would redirect that one
	    page to the (non-purple) address of your choice. Email
	    addresses at purple are available for 10 each per month if
	    you are leasing the main entry point.  <!-- You would have
	    to put a comment like this in the first 24x80 screen of
	    html where we redirect, letting people know where they can
	    find information about purple.com leasing. --></p>


	<p> <b>3.  Lease a subdomain.</b>  You may lease sub-domains
	    of purple (other than www) for 1000 per month. You must
	    host your own content: we merely point DNS at the IP of
	    your choice. For 100 per month additional you may handle
	    all email to your sub-domain of purple. Individual email
	    addresses at purple or at your sub-domain are otherwise
	    available for 10 each per month.</p>


	<p> <b>4.  License the entire site.</b>  You may license all
	    of purple.com, giving you the right to put all of your
	    content at www.purple.com, including hosting the site
	    itself. You would be required to maintain forwarding on
	    certain email addresses and redirects on a small number of
	    URL's, but none with names that should cause problems. The
	    cost of licensing the entire site is a one-time fee of
	    750,000 plus a monthly maintenance fee of 100 which may be
	    paid in advance annually.</p>

	<p> <b>5.  Have an email address.</b>  You may have an address
	    at friends.purple.com for 50 per month. The address is
	    licensed to you as long as you keep paying. You may do
	    anything you want with it except represent yourself as
	    having a relationship with purple.com other than leasing
	    the address or addresses you lease. You may not do
	    anything that gets us in legal trouble, and you may not
	    use it as a spam return address. We would forward that
	    address to the address of your choice: we would not offer
	    actual storage.</p>


	<h4>Some questions and their answers</h4>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> Why is this so expensive?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> To make my life simple.</p>


	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> This is too expensive! Won't you bring the price
	    down?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> The price is not negotiable. Everyone has
	    different ideas of expensive. If you feel this is too
	    expensive, you are welcome to find a less expensive domain
	    name.</p>


	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> What restrictions would I have on what I can do
	    with my sub-domain of purple?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> We impose no restrictions, except that it must
	    be legal, must not get us in legal problems, can't be for
	    purposes of spamming, etc.</p>


	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> Can I have an email address without paying all
	    those fees?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> No. That wouldn't be simple. (It doesn't
	    scale.)</p>


	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> Why is <a
	    href="http://www.purple.com/">http://www.purple.com/</a>
	    nearly all purple? Why does it link to a purple page?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> It makes my life simple.</p>


	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> Isn't there more?</p>


	<p> <b>A.</b> No.</p>

	<p>-</p>

	<p> <b>Q.</b> I don't want to lease, I want to buy!</p>

	<p> <b>A.</b> Leasing is a fairly standard business structure.
	    In most contexts you can achieve most of the rights you'd
	    like from purchase via lease, although you often have to
	    enumerate what you want.  If you really feel that leasing
	    purple.com doesn't work for you and you don't have a
	    credible argument for why, understand that I will wonder
	    what you are up to.</p>
