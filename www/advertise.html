    <h2>Purple.com Advertising Guidelines</h2>

    <p> You may advertise on purple.com.  Why you would do so is
	somewhat different than advertising on other sites, so please
	do read these guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p><ul>
	<li> Up to three words, about 20 characters max</li>
	<li> This is on the root page only</li>
	<li> Your ad will appear instead of "your ad here"</li>
	<li> The redirect to blank purple still happens after a couple seconds</li>
	<li> Your ad doesn't get me in trouble or cause me serious hassle</li>
	<li> If your content is NSFW, you link through an intermediate page
	    that gives fair warning and explanation</li>
    </ul></li></p>

    <h2>Cost</h2>

    <p>The cost is 50 per day for the first two words.  For longer ads, the
	price is 50+50*(w-2)^2 per day.  I.e., 100 for three words, 300 for
	four words, etc.  For images, the price is 0.10 per pixel per day.  So
	an 88x31 tag (2728 pixels) would cost 272.80 per day.  We are
	interested in the page loading quickly.</p>

    <h2>Details</h2>

    <p>You may only advertise on the <a href="index.html">root page</a>.
	That page receives about 15,000 views per day (of which some
	are surely robots and other automated entities).  Extensive
	anecdotal evidence suggests that the root page is viewed by
	people testing their browsers or simply playing with common
	English words.  Changes to that page tend to elicit comments
	and blog posts, so at least some people visit regularly and
	notice changes.</p>

    <p>Much of that traffic depends on the page being essentially
	blank purple and loading very fast.  I therefore require
	advertising to respect those constraints.  As such, you are
	limited to three words (and to about 20 characters, at our
	discretion).</p>

    <p>Since there is no substantive content on the root page, I can't
	help you target your advertisement to your audience.  I
	suspect the potential interest is precisely the fact that you
	would be paying to reach an unknown audience, for example to
	publicise a new product launch.</p>

    <p> In addition, I require that neither the words of your ad nor
	the initial page to which they jump should be obviously
	illegal in France, the United Kingdom, or the United States.
	They should also not be likely to offend too seriously in
	those countries.  (So please don't ask us to link to a cartoon
	of Mohammad or something that will cause us to be hassled,
	even if I take no personal position on your content.)</p>

    <p>
	If you want to link through to something questionable or NSFW
	(not safe for work), please link through an intermediate page
	which provides clear and adequate warning of what's about to
	happen (in English) and does not redirect for at least five
	seconds.  That should be enough to let people who don't want
	to continue on to abort.</p>

    <p> The pricing may vary with time and is designed to make
	sponsored links the exception and not the rule.  (That
	simplifies my life for now and increases the effect of your
	advertisement.)  It is currently 20 euros (or pound sterling)
	per day or 30 U.S. dollars per day.</p>

    <p> I am not currently planning on automating this service (beyond
	using cron to swap in your ad and pull it out again), even
	though my fingers twitch to write a simple word auction
	system.  But I don't think that's worth my time.  If you are
	interested in advertising, please email me, username "jeff".
	Please don't spam me.  Please use a clear subject.  Please
	contact me in advance of when you want your ad to run so that
	we have time to handle payment and set up the page.</p>

    <p>
	If you send me mail that does not appear to be constructive or
	serious, I may simply ignore it (and flag it as spam for my
	spam filter to handle next time).</p>

    <p>
	I am open to constructive feedback on the advertising program.
	My purpose is to cover my (miniscule) costs of running the
	site.  If I buy myself some good chocolate out of it, that's a
	nice plus.</p>
