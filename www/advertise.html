<h2>Purple.com Advertising Guidelines</h2>

<p>
You may advertise on purple.com.  Why you would do so is somewhat
different than advertising on other sites, so please do read these
guidelines.

<p>
You may only advertise on the <a href="index.html">root page</a>.
That page receives about 15,000 views per day (of which some are
surely robots and other automated entities).  Extensive anecdotal
evidence suggests that the root page is viewed by people testing their
browsers or simply playing with common English words.  Changes to that page
tend to elicit comments and blog posts, so at least some people visit
regularly and notice changes.

<p>
Much of that traffic depends on the page being essentially blank
purple and loading very fast.  I therefore require advertising to
respect those constraints.  As such, you are limited to three words
(and to about 20 characters, at our discretion).

<p>
Since there is no
substantive content on the root page, I can't help you target your
advertisement to your audience.  I suspect the potential interest is
precisely the fact that you would be paying to reach an unknown
audience, for example to publicise a new product launch.

<p> In addition, I require that neither the words of your ad nor the
initial page to which they jump should be obviously illegal in France, the
United Kingdom, or the United States.  They should also not be likely
to offend too seriously in those countries.  (So please don't ask us to link to a
cartoon of Mohammad or something that will cause us to be hassled,
even if I take no personal position on your content.)

<p>
If you want to link through to something questionable or NSFW (not
safe for work), please link through an intermediate page which
provides clear and adequate warning of what's about to happen (in
English) and does not redirect for at least five seconds.  That should
be enough to let people who don't want to continue on to abort.

<p> The pricing may vary with time and is designed to make sponsored
links the exception and not the rule.  (That simplifies my life for
now and increases the effect of your advertisement.)  It is currently
20 euros (or pound sterling) per day or 30 U.S. dollars per day.

<p> I am not currently planning on automating this service (beyond
using cron to swap in your ad and pull it out again), even though my
fingers twitch to write a simple word auction system.  But I don't
think that's worth my time.  If you are interested in advertising,
please email me, username "jeff".  Please don't spam me.  Please use a
clear subject.  Please contact me in advance of when you want your ad
to run so that we have time to handle payment and set up the page.

<p>
If you send me mail that does not appear to be constructive or
serious, I may simply ignore it (and flag it as spam for my spam
filter to handle next time).

<p>
I am open to constructive feedback on the advertising program.  My
purpose is to cover my (miniscule) costs of running the site.  If I
buy myself some good chocolate out of it, that's a nice plus.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>

<ul>
  <li> Up to three words, about 20 characters max
  <li> This is on the root page only
  <li> Your ad will appear instead of "your ad here" (<a href="index-template.html">example</a>)
  <li> The redirect to blank purple still happens after a couple seconds
  <li> Your ad doesn't get me in trouble or cause me serious hassle
  <li> If your content is NSFW, you link through an intermediate page
  that gives fair warning and explanation
</ul>
